    "LLM agents are one of the most powerful and fascinating technologies to come out of the huge explosion of LLMs since the introduction of ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using agents we are able to give LLMs access to tools. These tools give us an essentially infinite number of possibilities as they allow us to search the web, do maths, run code, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many prebuilt tools available from LangChain, but in many real world scenarios we need to build custom tools to fit the requirements of our use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how we can build custom tools for agents in LangChain. Starting with simple math functions to give us an idea of how it works, before moving on to using other ML models to give us even more abilities like describing images."

    "# What is an agent?\n",
    "__Definition:__ The key behind agents is giving LLM's the possibility of using tools in their workflow. This is where langchain departs from the popular chatgpt implementation and we can start to get a glimpse of what it offers us as builders. Until now, we covered several building blocks in isolation. Let's see them come to life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official definition of agents is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents use an LLM to determine which actions to take and in what order. An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this edition we will cover what we may call 'generic' agents which really able to perform many meta tasks. There are other more specific agents that are tuned for different tasks (called 'agent-toolkits'), but we will cover those in a future edition.\n",
    "\n",
